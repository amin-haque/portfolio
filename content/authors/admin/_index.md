I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Driven by curiosity and a love for solving problems, I have worked on a number of mechanical design and research projects, becoming proficient in various design and analysis software, experimental and simulation techniques, and developing a strong programming background. I always love to learn about new stuffs, whether it's understanding an academic concept or picking up a new language. When I'm not doing so, you may find me exploring a new street, watching anime, or playing video games.

Currently, I'm looking for PhD opportunities for fall 2025, focusing on **Material Behavior**, **Computational Mechanics**, **Advanced Materials**, **Additive Manufacturing**, **Machine Learning** and other relevant topics. I am particularly intrigued by the research on advanced materials with tailored properties by integrated data-driven methods like machine-learning with traditional experimental and computational methods.
